# Building and analysing a data warehouse project
This repository showcases my assignment project of building and analysing a data warehouse(DW) for a online sale website. The purpose of building the DW was to analyse the shopping behaviour of their customers in the future by using multidimensional data anlysis. The implementation of all SQL code was done on Oracle SQL developer which was connected to my university account.

The repository consist of three parts:

Part 1 : build a DW using star schema

part 2 : enrich customer transaction data and store in DW

part 3 : conduct multidimensional data analysis using OLAP queries
